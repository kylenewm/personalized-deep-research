# Save Context

Save current context to prevent loss.

## Do Immediately

1. Update STATE.md with:
   - What you're currently working on
   - Any blockers or decisions made
   - Current status of tasks

2. Append to LOG.md:
   - What happened this session
   - Key findings or changes
   - Timestamp the entry

3. Confirm: "Context saved"

## When to Use

- Long conversation getting complex
- Before switching tasks
- When user says "save" or "snapshot"
- Before context compaction risk
